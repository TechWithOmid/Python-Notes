# Python-Notes
My notes on the python programming language.

These note are for begginners, like myself to refer to. These notes can be redistrubuted or changed in every way so long as they do 
not mislead other learners. These notes are completely free and will be updated as I learn more of the python programming language.
If you see something that is incorrect, inaccurate or could just be worded better, please let me know and I will make the necessary changes.
Everyone is welcome to download or add to this repository. I encourage it :)
